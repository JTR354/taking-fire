#### Summary for stage one (twenty-five Feb. 2024)

At this stage, the biggest achievement is that I have the right way to learn English, that is, starting with listening, to learn word and grammar, etc.
My main learning materials are EnglishPod and daily video by teacher from WeChat group. The longer I study every, the better.

In this mock interview, I feel I can understand a lot, but the details need strengthened, that is to say, the heat is not enough,come on and continue to work hard.
