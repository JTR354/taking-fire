# Difference between "null" and "undefined"

> First, "Undefined" and "Null" are both basic data types, and they have only one value, namely "undefined" and "null".
>
> "undefined" meas not defined and "null" means empty object. Generally, When a variable is declared but not defined, "undefined" is returned. "null" is mainly used to assign values to variables that may return objects for initialization.
>
> "undefined" is not a reserved  word in JavaScript, which means that "undefined" can be used as a variable name, but this is very dangrous, it will affect the judgement of "undefined" value. We can use some methods to obtain secure "undefined" value, such as "void 0".
>
> When "typeof" is used to judge the two types, "Null" typing returns "object", which is a problem left over from history. "true" is returned when two types of values are compared with doblue equal signs, and false is returned when three equal signs are used.
